# Travel App

## Introduction

*Travel App* is a mobile application designed for travelers to share and explore travel experiences. Users can document their journeys with photos, videos, and narratives, creating a vivid digital diary of their adventures. The app also allows for exploration of places through the stories shared by others, offering inspiration and insights into different locales worldwide.

## Key Features

- **Post Creation:** Users can create posts with text, images, and videos, capturing the essence of their travel experiences.
- **Media Integration:** The app supports capturing new photos and videos directly or selecting existing ones from the device's gallery.
- **Geolocation:** Posts can be tagged with geographical data, allowing users to share the exact locations of their adventures.
- **Interactive Map:** A map view displays posts based on their geolocation, enabling users to visually explore travels.
- **Direct Post Editing:** Users can edit their posts directly within the app, ensuring their stories remain accurate and up-to-date.
- **Local Storage:** The app utilizes AsyncStorage for storing posts locally, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native:** A framework for building native apps using React.
- **Expo:** An open-source platform used for building and serving React Native apps.
- **AsyncStorage:** For local storage of posts and related data.
- **React Navigation:** To handle navigation between different screens within the app.
- **Expo Image Picker:** For capturing and selecting photos and videos from the device.
- **Expo Location:** To fetch geolocation data for posts.
